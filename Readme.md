## ▶️ How to Run

### Using Java (for Java-based problems):

1. Navigate to the problem folder:
   ```bash
   cd Chess/src
   ```
2. Compile and run:
    ```bash
   javac -d out *.java
   java -cp out Main
    ```
   Or, if using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, open the folder as a project and run the Main class.
